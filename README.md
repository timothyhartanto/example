Unique Value

Boy being a small kid, likes to play a lot, but he only likes to play with arrays.
While playing he came up with an interesting question which he could not solve, can you please solve it for him?

From a set of values, there is a unique value of the items (only appears once). For simplicity, the collection has an odd items (2n + 1), and certainly there is only one unique item while other items in pairs. For example, group of values {13, 11, 15, 12, 14, 15, 13, 11, 14}. From the group consisting of 9 items, it seems that the value 11 appears in pairs, the value 13 appears in pairs, the value 14 appears in pairs, the value 15 appears in pairs, while the value of 12 appears once (unique).

Create a function that is able to provide the answer to a unique value (12)!

Sample test:
input: [13, 11, 15, 12, 14, 15, 13, 11, 14]
output: 12



Classification

Create a function to know if two rectangles are cross each other (part of the rectangles are on each other), differ (if none of the rectangle area are on each other), inside (if one of the rectangle is inside of the other rectangle)

For input (original x, original y, length x, length y)

Input: [Rectangle A(0,5,10,5), Rectangle B(3,3,5,6)]

Output: Cross
